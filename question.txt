Additional Information and Resources

Your supervisor has asked you to find a way to automate and audit basic system configuration for new servers in your environment. Given that Ansible is already configured at a basic level in your environment, the simplest solution would be to just write a playbook for bootstrapping your new hosts. Create a playbook called /home/ansible/bootstrap.yml to fulfill the following boot strap requirements:



All servers:



Edit /etc/hosts to include the following entry:

ansible.xyzcorp.com  169.168.0.1

Install elinks

Create the user xyzcorp_audit

Copy the files /home/ansible/motd and /home/ansible/issue to /etc/



Network servers:

Install nmap-ncat

Create the user xyzcorp_network



SysAdmin servers:

Copy /home/ansible/scripts.tgz from the control node to /mnt/storage
